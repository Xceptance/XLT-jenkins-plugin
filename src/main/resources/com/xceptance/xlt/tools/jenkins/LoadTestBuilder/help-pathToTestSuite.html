	<p>
		Specify the path to your XLT test suite. The path can be either <em>relative</em> or <em>absolute</em>. In case the path is
		relative, the path will be resolved against the build job's workspace directory.
	</p>
	<p>Use a relative path if your test suite is not located directly in the root directory of the workspace, but in a
		sub-directory. If your test suite is located somewhere outside the job's workspace in an arbitrary directory on your disk,
		enter an absolute path to this directory. When leaving the path empty, the test suite is expected to reside directly in the
		workspace.</p>
